/**
 * The overview when a sub-read was REFUSED and everything else answered.
 *
 * `myPodOpenclawStatus` throws by design rather than reporting an unreachable pod, and the
 * transport turns that throw into a successful field carrying a failed envelope - so the
 * AgentOS section draws the workspace it did get AND the refusal sentence beneath it, keyed off
 * the envelope's `error` code rather than its English `message`.
 *
 * THE CONSOLE FRAME IS MOUNTED HERE, and the reason is recorded in `app/layout.tsx` beside the
 * composition it hands over: the frame needs the LOCAL contract table, the local `Tree` typed by
 * it and `ConsoleNav`, none of which the document shell may reach. Mounting it in the route is
 * lawful on its own terms - `main-landmark-belongs-to-a-route-file` admits a route `page.tsx`
 * exactly as it admits a layout, because the guarantee is ONE `main` owned by whoever owns the
 * whole screen. At Apply the identical tree moves up to `apps/app/src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx`,
 * where the rail stands while a client-routed body is replaced underneath it - a claim a static
 * export cannot show either way, and which the entry's own `why` is what actually carries.
 *
 * TARGET: `apps/app/src/app/[locale]/page.tsx`.
 *
 * @returns The route.
