/**
 * The overview for an account that has bought nothing yet - the state a real account is in
 * today.
 *
 * The apps section offers the CATALOGUE rather than a hardcoded button, AgentOS offers a
 * settled notice, and the servers and domains sections each say one sentence with no press so a
 * deliberate absence never reads as an unbought one. The wallet shows a real zero, because it
 * is created on first read.
 *
 * THE CONSOLE FRAME IS MOUNTED HERE, and the reason is recorded in `app/layout.tsx` beside the
 * composition it hands over: the frame needs the LOCAL contract table, the local `Tree` typed by
 * it and `ConsoleNav`, none of which the document shell may reach. Mounting it in the route is
 * lawful on its own terms - `main-landmark-belongs-to-a-route-file` admits a route `page.tsx`
 * exactly as it admits a layout, because the guarantee is ONE `main` owned by whoever owns the
 * whole screen. At Apply the identical tree moves up to `apps/app/src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx`,
 * where the rail stands while a client-routed body is replaced underneath it - a claim a static
 * export cannot show either way, and which the entry's own `why` is what actually carries.
 *
 * TARGET: `apps/app/src/app/[locale]/page.tsx`.
 *
 * @returns The route.
